# Secure-Login-Signup-Page
This project is a fully secured login-signup system that ensures data privacy and authentication. It saves user data in a MySQL database upon signup, and users must register before logging in. Upon successful login, the backend generates a token that is sent to the frontend to maintain security throughout the session.
